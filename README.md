# About Dataset
This dataset contains three files:

The cellphone data.csv contains data on the most popular cell phones in the US in 2022. The data for each cell phone consists of the most notable features such as performance rating (AnTuTu), memory size, camera's resolution, battery size, screen size, release date, etc. The price of each cell phone collected from Amazon and Best-Buy (in Aug 22). Overall, in our dataset there are 34 cell phones with 13 features.

The user's data and their ratings are in cellphones users.csv and cellphones ratings.csv. To elicit the ratings, we conducted a survey on Mechanical Turk. Each participant was presented with 10 random cell phones, and she was asked to indicate how likely she is to purchase each of the cell phones at the given price, on a scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 10 (very likely). We also asked each participant to add personal information: age, gender, and occupation.

This dataset can be used for building a recommendation system model that relies mainly on the features of the items.
